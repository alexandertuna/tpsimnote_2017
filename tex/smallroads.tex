  \caption{Sketch of the road coverage of the proposed MMTP algorithm, for a small chamber closest to the beamline (left) and large chamber farthest from the beamline (right). The $X$ road is horizontal, the $U$ road is pink and slanted, and the $V$ road is blue and slanted. For ease of digestion, only one pair of $U$ and $V$ roads are shown, and they do not cover the entire $X$ road. The x-axis and y-axis are in units of strip pitches, which are 0.4 mm.}

The $X$ road is horizontal, the $U$ roads are pink and slanted, and the $V$ roads are blue and slanted. The small chamber requires five pairs of $U$ and $V$ roads to cover one $X$ road, and the large chamber requires 19. The x-axis and y-axis are in units of strip pitches, which are 0.4 mm.}
